How do I approach designing software?

I have always broke down the requirements into parts so I can start working on each requirement separately as this makes projects easier instead of trying to bite into the pie whole I slice it into chucks and take small bites to make things easier, this has made my life has a software developer extremely easy and for the most part pretty stressfree.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I have never actually worked with OpenGL or any type of visualization software before this so everything was new for me and I actually had a lot of fun with it as I was able to play with a lot of things when it came to creating shapes and adding things to those shapes such as lighting, camera movement etc, but to be able to add everything together and really create a work was fun, and each weeks milestone really made the project easy and I was able to fully understand things and see how everything worked together.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I don't plan on going into any type of development that deals with graphics as I actually enjoy video games to much to ruin them for myself however the skillset is helpful as I may wish to do something in my freetime or as a side project but they also help as I may be able to give knowledge to coworkers as this is a skill that I can actually explain.
